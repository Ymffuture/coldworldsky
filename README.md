## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

1. **Routing Issue:**
   - Ensure the `vercel.json` file has the correct rewrite rules to handle nested routes.

   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Refreshing Nested Routes:**
   - Use the above rewrite configuration to avoid 404 errors when refreshing pages like `/courses/ui-ux`.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Regularly test the site on multiple devices to ensure consistent user experience.
